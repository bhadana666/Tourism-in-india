country like INDIA with different culture and landscapes a place with different 
languages different people's different places. One major, most common problem is 
Tourism. Tourists visiting India often face challenges in planning their trips effectively and 
navigating through the vast array of tourist attractions, accommodations, and activities. 
They struggle to find personalized recommendations tailored to their interests and 
preferences, leading to generic and uninspiring travel experiences. Additionally, tourists 
encounter uncertainties regarding crowd levels, weather conditions, and safety, which can 
impact their overall enjoyment and satisfaction. Furthermore, tourism stakeholders, 
including government agencies and local businesses, lack access to timely insights and 
data-driven decision-making tools to optimize resource allocation and enhance visitor 
experiences. There is also a lack of smart assistance and engagement platforms to support 
tourists throughout their journey and foster community interaction. Addressing these 
challenges requires innovative solutions that leverage technology to provide personalized 
trip planning, real-time insights, and smart assistance for tourists, while empowering 
tourism stakeholders with data-driven tools for sustainable tourism management and 
economic growth.
